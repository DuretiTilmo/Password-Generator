# Password Generator

## JavaScript: Password Generator

### Description

This challenge was to modify a starter code to create an application that enables users to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. When the user clicks the button "Generate Password" they are first promoted for password length. If outside the range of 8-128, the users are prompted to once again to enter a password length within that range. 

Then the users are prompted to define if they would like to include numbers, characters, uppercase and/or lowercase letters. If the user selects none to all criteria, the program will send alert message to select at least one of the characters and will loop back again through the prompts. Finally when all the inputs are validated, the password will be generated and it will appear inside the password box on the screen as shown below.
